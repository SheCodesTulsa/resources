What is all the hype about the cloud? In this session Shawn will provide a brief high level overview about Azure. Together we will then complete a hands on lab where we will learn how to create and deploy mission-critical web applications that scale with your business with Azure App Service Web Apps.

Azure App Service Web Apps (or just Web Apps) is a service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. You can develop in your favorite language, be it .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. Applications run and scale with ease on Windows and Linux based environments.

NOTE: Please bring your laptop so you can participate in this Hands on Experience.
